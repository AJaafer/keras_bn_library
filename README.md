# A collection of extensions library for Keras

Includes:

 - Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
   - GGaussian-Bernoulli
   - NRLU hidden unit
   - Softmax hidden unit
   - Persistent Contrastive divergence
   - Dropout for hidden unit
 - Deep Belief Network (DBN)
 - RNN-RBM
  - independent RBM pre-training
 -Variational LSTM Auto-Encoder
 
These extensions were validated in Keras 1.2.0 and python 3.5 (Anaconda)

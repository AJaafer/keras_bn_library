# A collection of extensions library for Keras

Includes:

 - Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
   - Gaussian-Bernoulli unit
   - NRLU hidden unit
   - Softmax hidden unit
   - Persistent Contrastive divergence
   - Dropout for hidden unit
 - Deep Belief Network (DBN)
 - RNN-RBM
   - independent RBM pre-training
 - Variational LSTM auto-encoder
 
These extensions were validated in Keras 1.2.0 and python 3.5 (Anaconda).
Tensorflow and Theano backend also work fine in Keras. Please refer to some examples to use libraries.
